    Homework Task 8
    Writen by Chris Burley

# Name of Project:

    Homework Task 8
    Part Names: (1) climate_starter.ipymb   (2) app.py   (3) Precipitation_Bar_Chart.png   (4)  USC00519281_Histogram_Last 12_months.png

# Description:

	In this project I have written scripts which, to my knowledge, satisfy every section of the task. 
	See screen captures 1 - 6 which I have uploaded to this repository. They show main features that we were required to create.
    There are also PNG files showing the two required graphs.

# Activation of a script:

    (1) Locate the scripts called climate_starter.ipymb and app.py. 
 
	(2) Run the former in Jupyter.

    (3) To run the app.py file you may first need to run "source activate PythonData" in gitbash. Then simply type "python app.py".
        You will then be given a URL to type into chrome.
